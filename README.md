<h1>API's</h1>

<h3>What are APIâ€™s? How are they used and why are they so popular?</h3>

Firstly, "API" stands for "application programming interface" and essentially means that a two-way communication can be done
by the use of two computer programs using set of protocols and definitions. They are used by the initial communication between
a product and a service, in turn implementing it automatically. When new or the existing tools or products are designed, APIs are
very flexible which simplifies design and showcases innovations. They can also count as contracts, which means a party can request a
relevant documentation in a specific way, and party 2 has to respond to the request, in that format. They help IT teams and business collaborate, 
where rapid changes within the app can be made. 

APIs are popular due to the factors such as, innovation, which allow rapid innovation and change is easily done, 
efficiency, that automatically allows for more efficient data distribution and adaptability, which adapts through the data migration and the
flexibility of services.

<h3>What is a REST API? What makes an API RESTful?</h3>

REST or RESTful, it stands for "Representational state transfer" and is an API is an interface to exchange information securely over the internet that two computer systems use.
it's fundamentally an architechtural style that means a set of rules in order to create web services. It's a client server communicator, which creates an object of the requested data
by the client and values of objects are thus sent in response to the user -"POST, GET, PUT, DELETE". For the API to be RESTful , it has to follow the principles of the REST API, which are
Client-server decoupling, Uniform interface, statelessness, layered system architecture, that it's cacheable and lastly code on demand.

<h3>What is HTTP? (what does it stand for and what is it used for?)</h3>

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is a method for encoding and migrating the information between client and a web server. It's primary protocol for the transmission is the relevant information is migrated across the internet.

<h3>HTTP request structure diagram </h3>

An HTTP Request structure is made out of three vital components, headers, request line and message body.
The verbs iterate, GET (retrieve single item OR a list of items), POST (create an item), PUT (update and item), and DELETE (delete and item). These are request methods to indicate a desired action to be performed
for a given task. The URL(universal Resource Locator), means that it's a named host, which is located in the server, which includes information that are needed to access the resource.
